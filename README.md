# Weather Dashboard

##  User Story

As a traveller who visits many cities I want to use be able to access the current and future forecast so that I may plan my trips wherever my travels may take me.

## Acceptance Criteria

When presented with a weather application with form inputs the user will input the search city into the search field.
Then the user is presented with the current day and the forecast rendered on the page including the temperature in Fahrenheit, the humidity and the wind speed.
They are also presented with the 5 day forecast for that city and icons of the weather conditions expected.
These searches are saved to local storage and a clear history button is available.
